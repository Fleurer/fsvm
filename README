==About

*Fsvm* is a Stack Virtual Machine for experiment. It has only a few opcodes(less than 30), but 've implmented function calling and closure. You can make it as your lanuage's VM, though I'm not quite sure about this :(  

==Installation

well, it's even not alpha, `src/main.c` is just some stuff on testing. To run the testing code, just

    rake

All code coded in GNU/Linux, I'm not sure what will happen under windows.
